<h1>Spam-NoSpam Classification Project</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model for classifying messages as either spam or not spam (ham) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Spam classification is a common problem in the field of text classification and has various applications, including email filtering, comment moderation, and text message classification.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Before you begin, ensure you have the following libraries and tools installed:

Python (3.6+)
Jupyter Notebook (recommended for experimenting and prototyping)<br>
scikit-learn<br>
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text preprocessing<br>
Pandas for data manipulation<br>
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization<br>
A dataset containing labeled messages (spam and ham)<br>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
You'll need a dataset containing text messages labeled as spam or ham. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed, with labels and text data.

<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
Data preprocessing is crucial for NLP tasks. You may need to:

Tokenize text: Split messages into words or subword units.<br>
Remove punctuation and special characters.<br>
Convert text to lowercase.<br>
Remove stop words (common words like "the," "and," "is").<br>
Stemming or Lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.<br>
Vectorize text using techniques like TF-IDF.<br>
<h2>Model Selection</h2>
Choose an appropriate machine learning model for text classification, I selected SVM and Random Forest after trying all models. Common models include:

Multinomial Naive Bayes<br>
Logistic Regression<br>
Support Vector Machines (SVM)<br>
Decision Trees<br>
Random Forest<br>
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)<br>
<h2>Training and Evaluation</h2>
Split your dataset into training and testing sets. Train your model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the testing data. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC.

<h2>Hyperparameter Tuning</h2>
Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance. Techniques like grid search and random search can be helpful.

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
Explore deep learning models like LSTM or CNN for text classification.<br>
Implement real-time email or SMS filtering systems.<br>
Incorporate user feedback to continuously improve the model's accuracy.<br>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
This project aims to build a spam-no spam classification model using NLP and machine learning techniques. It's a valuable tool for various applications where automatic text classification is needed, such as email filtering, message spam detection, and content moderation. Feel free to experiment with different models and datasets to enhance the performance of your classifier.
